# Basic Programs

Welcome to the **Basic Programs Repository**! This repository contains a collection of simple programs and code snippets that I've created during my early learning of programming basics. Some of these programs are inspired by the CS50 course.

## Introduction

As I embarked on my programming journey, I decided to gather and share my progress in this repository. Here, you'll find a variety of basic programs written in different programming languages. These programs cover fundamental concepts and serve as a reference for beginners and learners alike.
